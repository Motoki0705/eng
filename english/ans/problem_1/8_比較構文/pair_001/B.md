## 詳細解説

### 1. as rationally as economists once assumed「経済学者がかつて想定していたほど合理的に」

**英文**: people do not always buy products as rationally as economists once assumed

**解説**:
- `as + 副詞 + as ...` の比較構文
- 否定 not always と組み合わさり「必ずしも～ほど...とは限らない」
- assumed の目的語（that節）が省略されている
- once = 「かつて」（過去の副詞）

**Next Stage参照**: No. 179

**例文**:
- He is not as tall as I thought.（彼は私が思っていたほど背が高くない）
- She doesn't work as hard as she used to.（彼女は以前ほど一生懸命働いていない）

### 2. the question of why「なぜ～かという問題」

**英文**: the question of why consumers make the choices

**解説**:
- the question of + 間接疑問文
- why consumers make the choices = 「なぜ消費者がその選択をするのか」
- 間接疑問文は名詞節として働く
- 前置詞 of の目的語として機能

**Next Stage参照**: No. 446

**例文**:
- The question of how to solve this problem is important.（この問題をどう解決するかという問題は重要だ）
- We discussed the question of why sales had dropped.（なぜ売上が落ちたのかという問題を議論した）

### 3. the choices they do「彼らがする選択」

**英文**: make the choices they do

**解説**:
- they do = they make（代動詞 do）
- 「彼らがする（ような）選択」
- 関係代名詞 that/which が省略されている
- the choices (that/which) they do make → the choices they do

**例文**:
- I don't understand why she behaves the way she does.（なぜ彼女がそのように振る舞うのか理解できない）

## 和訳のコツ

1. **not always ... as ... as は「必ずしも～ほど...とは限らない」**: 部分否定
2. **the question of why は「なぜ～かという問題」**: 間接疑問文を名詞化
3. **代動詞 do に注意**: 「そのような選択をする」と補って訳す
