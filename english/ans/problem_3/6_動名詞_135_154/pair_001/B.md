## 詳細な解説

### (a) My mother was busy ( **preparing** ) dinner for the guests.

**正解**: 3

**Next Stage参照**: No. 150 - be busy (in) doing

**解説**:
be busy (in) doing は「…するのに忙しい」という意味の表現です。in は省略されることが多いです。

**覚えるべき形**:
`be busy (in) doing「…するのに忙しい」`

**例文**:
- She was busy preparing for the exam.
- He is busy writing his thesis.

### (b) I feel like ( **taking** ) a long walk in the park today.

**正解**: 3

**Next Stage参照**: No. 153 - feel like doing

**解説**:
feel like doing は「…したい気がする」という意味の慣用表現です。feel inclined to do と同意です。like は前置詞なので、後には動名詞が来ます。

**覚えるべき形**:
`feel like doing = feel inclined to do「…したい気がする」`

**例文**:
- I don't feel like going out tonight.
- Do you feel like having a cup of coffee?

### (c) ( **It** ) goes without saying that health is important.

**正解**: 2

**Next Stage参照**: No. 152 - It goes without saying that節

**解説**:
It goes without saying that ... は「…は言うまでもない」という意味の慣用表現です。needless to say と同意です。It は形式主語で、that節が真主語です。

**覚えるべき形**:
`It goes without saying that ... = Needless to say, ...`

**例文**:

### (d) She is ashamed ( **of having** ) lied to her parents.

**正解**: 2

**Next Stage参照**: No. 138 - 動名詞の否定語（動名詞の直前）& No. 137 - 完了動名詞

**解説**:
be ashamed of doing は「…したことを恥じている」という意味です。過去に嘘をついたことを恥じているので、完了動名詞 having lied を使います。前置詞 of が必要なので、of having が正解です。

**覚えるべき形**:
`be ashamed of having done「…したことを恥じている」`

**例文**:
- He is ashamed of having behaved so rudely.
- I am ashamed of not having studied harder.

**正解**: 4

**Next Stage参照**: No. 146 - when it comes to A / doing

**解説**:
when it comes to A / doing は「話が、Aに / …することになると」という意味の慣用表現です。この to は前置詞なので、後には名詞または動名詞が来ます。

**覚えるべき形**:
`when it comes to A / doing「Aのことになると」`

**例文**:
- When it comes to music, he knows everything.
- When it comes to speaking English, she is very confident.

### (f) What do you say ( **to going** ) for a picnic this weekend?

**正解**: 3

**Next Stage参照**: No. 147 - What do you say to A / doing?

**解説**:
What do you say to A / doing? は「Aはいかがですか / …しませんか」という意味の勧誘表現です。How about doing? と同意です。この to は前置詞なので、後には名詞または動名詞が来ます。

**覚えるべき形**:
`What do you say to doing? = How about doing?「…しませんか」`

**例文**:

- What do you say to taking a short break?
