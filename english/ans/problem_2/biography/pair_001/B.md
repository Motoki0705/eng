## 選択肢の正誤解説

| 番号 | 正誤 | 選択肢 | 解説 |
|:---:|:---:|--------|------|
| 11 | ✗ | Turing's teachers at school praised his exceptional handwriting skills. | 本文では"Teachers often criticized his untidy handwriting"（先生たちはよく彼の乱雑な字を批判した）とあり、正反対。 |
| 12 | ○ | The concept of the Turing machine was developed before any practical computers were built. | 本文に"This paper laid the theoretical foundation for all modern computers, though no practical computer existed at the time"と明記。 |
| 13 | ✗ | The German Enigma machine was broken by Turing without using any mechanical assistance. | 本文では"Turing designed a machine called the 'Bombe'"とあり、機械を使用したことが明らか。 |
| 14 | ○ | Some historians believe the codebreaking work at Bletchley Park may have shortened the war. | 本文に"Historians estimate that the work done at Bletchley Park shortened the war by two to four years"と明記。 |
| 15 | ✗ | The Turing Test is designed to evaluate whether machines can perfectly imitate human emotions. | 本文では"whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human"（人間と区別できない知的行動）とあり、「感情を完璧に模倣」とは異なる。 |
| 16 | ○ | Turing avoided prison by agreeing to undergo chemical treatment. | 本文に"Rather than face imprisonment, he accepted chemical castration as an alternative punishment"と明記。 |
| 17 | ✗ | Turing died at Bletchley Park while still working on codebreaking projects. | 本文では"Two years later, in 1954, he died from cyanide poisoning"とあり、1954年に亡くなった。戦時中の暗号解読作業中ではない。 |
| 18 | ✗ | The British government apologized for Turing's treatment during his lifetime. | 本文では"In 2009, the British government issued an official apology"とあり、これはTuringの死後（1954年没）のことである。 |
| 19 | ✗ | Queen Elizabeth II personally met Turing before granting him a royal pardon. | 本文では"granted Turing a posthumous royal pardon"（死後の恩赦）とあり、直接会ったわけではない。 |
| 20 | ○ | Turing is now honored on British currency as recognition of his contributions. | 本文に"Today, his face appears on the British fifty-pound note"と明記。 |

## 読解のポイント

### 1. 時系列の把握
- 1912年：ロンドン生まれ
- 1936年：チューリングマシンの論文発表
- 第二次世界大戦中：ブレッチリー・パークで暗号解読
- 1950年：チューリングテストを提案
- 1952年：同性愛行為で起訴
- 1954年：死去（41歳）
- 2009年：英国政府が公式謝罪
- 2013年：女王による死後恩赦

### 2. 注意すべき表現

- "posthumous" = 「死後の」（選択肢19の誤りを見抜くキーワード）
