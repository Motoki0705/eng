## 選択肢の正誤解説

| 番号 | 正誤 | 選択肢 | 解説 |
|:---:|:---:|--------|------|
| 11 | ✗ | Marie Curie moved to Paris because Polish universities did not allow women to study. | 「ポーランドの大学が女性の入学を許可しなかったから」とあるが、本文では"Poland was under Russian rule, and educational opportunities for women were extremely limited"（ロシア支配下で女性への教育機会が非常に限られていた）とあり、「許可しなかった」とは異なる。 |
| 12 | ○ | Marie finished her studies in Paris with degrees in both physics and mathematics. | 本文に"she earned her degree in physics...and the following year she received a second degree in mathematics"と明記。 |
| 13 | ✗ | The Curies met Henri Becquerel in their laboratory while researching mysterious rays. | 本文には彼らが研究室でBecquerelと出会ったという記述はない。本文では"the mysterious rays that had recently been discovered by Henri Becquerel"と、Becquerelが既に発見した光線について研究したとあるのみ。 |
| 14 | ✗ | Marie named one of the elements she discovered after her birthplace, Warsaw. | 本文では"polonium, named after Marie's homeland Poland"（祖国ポーランドに因んで名付けた）とあり、生誕地のワルシャワではない。 |
| 15 | ○ | Pierre Curie insisted that Marie be included in the Nobel Prize award. | 本文に"it was only after Pierre insisted that his wife be included that she received the recognition"と明記。 |
| 16 | ✗ | After Pierre's death, Marie abandoned scientific research to focus on teaching. | 本文では"Devastated but determined to continue their work"とあり、研究を続けたことが分かる。 |
| 17 | ✗ | Marie Curie won Nobel Prizes in the same scientific field twice. | 本文に"won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields"（2つの異なる科学分野で受賞）と明記。物理学と化学で1回ずつ。 |
| 18 | ○ | During World War I, Marie Curie helped treat wounded soldiers using X-ray technology. | 本文に"developing mobile X-ray units...to help treat wounded soldiers"と明記。 |
| 19 | ✗ | Marie Curie died because of a car accident while driving a mobile X-ray unit. | 本文では"died in 1934 from aplastic anemia...caused by her prolonged exposure to radiation"と、放射線被曝による病気で亡くなったとある。 |
| 20 | ○ | Marie Curie's research materials are still dangerous to handle today because of radiation. | 本文に"her laboratory notebooks are so radioactive that they must be stored in lead-lined boxes"と明記。 |
