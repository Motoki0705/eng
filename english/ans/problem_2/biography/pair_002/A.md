## 選択肢の正誤解説

| 番号 | 正誤 | 選択肢 | 解説 |
|:---:|:---:|--------|------|
| 11 | ✗ | Mandela became involved in politics after graduating from law school. | 本文には政治参加とロースクール卒業の時系列関係が明確に書かれていない。"he studied law and became involved in the fight against apartheid"とあり、同時並行の可能性がある。 |
| 12 | ○ | The ANC initially tried to change the system through non-violent methods. | 本文に"For many years, Mandela and the ANC pursued peaceful methods of protest"と明記。 |
| 13 | ✗ | Mandela established a military group before the Sharpeville massacre occurred. | 本文では"after the Sharpeville massacre in 1960...He helped establish a military wing"とあり、事件の後である。 |
| 14 | ✗ | Mandela was sentenced to life in prison for encouraging workers to protest. | 本文では終身刑は1964年に宣告されたが、1962年の逮捕理由が"leaving the country illegally and encouraging workers to strike"であり、終身刑の直接の理由とは書かれていない。 |
| 15 | ○ | While in prison, Mandela earned an academic degree through distance learning. | 本文に"earning a law degree through a correspondence course"と明記。 |
| 16 | ✗ | Mandela rejected offers of release because he refused to give up violent resistance. | 本文では"refused offers of freedom that were conditional on renouncing violence"（暴力を放棄することを条件とした釈放を拒否）とあり、「暴力的抵抗を放棄することを拒否した」という表現は誤り。条件付きの釈放を拒否したのであり、暴力そのものを放棄しなかったわけではない。 |
| 17 | ✗ | F.W. de Klerk won the Nobel Peace Prize before Mandela was released from prison. | 本文ではマンデラの釈放が1990年、ノーベル平和賞が1993年と明記。釈放後である。 |
| 18 | ○ | Mandela became South Africa's first president to be democratically elected. | 本文に"in the first democratic elections in South Africa's history, Mandela was elected president"と明記。 |
| 19 | ✗ | The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was focused on punishing those who committed crimes during apartheid. | 本文では"gave victims and perpetrators...the opportunity to tell their stories"（話す機会を与えた）とあり、処罰ではなく和解が目的。 |
| 20 | ○ | Mandela served only one term as president despite being eligible for re-election. | 本文に"After serving one term as president, Mandela chose not to seek re-election"と明記。 |
