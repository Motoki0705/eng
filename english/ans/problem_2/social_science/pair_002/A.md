## 選択肢の正誤解説

| 番号 | 正誤 | 選択肢 | 解説 |
|:---:|:---:|--------|------|
| 11 | ✗ | Approximately 3,500 languages are expected to survive until the end of this century. | 本文では"of the approximately 7,000 languages...nearly half may disappear"とあり、約半分が消滅 = 約3,500が生き残るという計算になるが、"約3,500が生き残ると予想される"という断定的な表現は本文の"may disappear"という推測的な表現と合わない。 |
| 12 | ○ | Languages often disappear because young people choose to learn more widely used languages. | 本文に"Languages typically die when younger generations stop learning them, often because they see greater economic or social advantages in speaking a dominant language"と明記。 |
| 13 | ✗ | The spread of English has completely replaced all local languages around the world. | 本文では"people are becoming multilingual, adding English to their linguistic repertoire while continuing to speak their native languages"とあり、完全な置き換えではない。 |
| 14 | ○ | Educated city dwellers often use different languages for different situations. | 本文に"educated urban populations...may use different languages for different purposes"と明記。 |
| 15 | ✗ | Technology has not been useful in efforts to preserve endangered languages. | 本文では"Others have used technology to create digital archives"とあり、技術は役立っている。 |
| 16 | ○ | Some languages that were considered dead have been brought back to life. | 本文に"languages that were thought to be extinct have been revived"と明記。 |
| 17 | ○ | Studies suggest that speaking multiple languages may have mental benefits. | 本文に"multilingual individuals often have cognitive advantages, including better problem-solving skills and greater mental flexibility"と明記。 |
| 18 | ✗ | Endangered languages contain no useful information for scientists. | 本文では"specialized vocabulary...could be valuable for scientific research"とあり、科学研究に価値がある。 |
| 19 | ✗ | There are sufficient resources to preserve all endangered languages. | 本文では"how to allocate limited resources for preservation"とあり、資源は限られている。 |
| 20 | ✗ | Experts all agree on which languages should be prioritized for preservation. | 本文では"remains a subject of debate among scholars"とあり、議論が続いている。 |
