〔Ⅰ〕 次の英文の下線部を和訳せよ。

In the past, it was common for people to mention discomfort related to sleep or daytime dullness when consulting their doctor for pain, high blood pressure or depression. However, sleep problems were almost never thought of as an illness. This has changed. The phenomenon of sleep and the environment for sleep have become medicalised. **Physicians have strong opinions about ‘normal’ and ‘healthy’ sleep and they have many pieces of advice on how to obtain it: at what time people should go to bed, at what time they have to get up, and how long they are supposed to sleep.**

注 discomfort 不快
　 medicalise 医学的方法を適用する
