〔Ⅰ〕 次の英文の下線部を和訳せよ。

Stress has been shown to increase habitual behavior — for better or worse. Two experiments at UCLA and one at Duke University found that stress increased people’s gravitation toward habitual behavior. Based on her study in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, Professor Wendy Wood argues: “**People can’t make decisions easily when stressed, when their will is weak, or when they feel overwhelmed. When you are too tired to make a decision, you tend to just repeat what you usually do.**” This holds true for both good and bad habits.
