〔Ⅰ〕 次の英文の下線部を和訳せよ。

Almost every day we talk about sleep, telling our families how we have slept, or wishing them a good night’s sleep. Every child knows what he or she is supposed to do when sent off to bed. Moreover, according to the various time-use surveys conducted worldwide, sleep occupies by far the largest part of everyday life. **Thus it is certainly important for us to study how people organise sleep: when, for how long, where and how people sleep as well as what values and meanings they assign to it.**

注 time-use survey(s) 生活時間調査
