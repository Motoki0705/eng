〔Ⅰ〕 次の英文の下線部を和訳せよ。

Many people resolve to lose weight or exercise more in the new year. But the night before, they are likely to eat heartily, filling up on particular foods believed to bring health and good fortune for the next year. In Spain, for example, for every chime of the clock at midnight, people eat one grape. **Each of the twelve grapes represents good luck for a month of the coming year, but only those who can get them all in their mouths before the clock finishes striking will be able to enjoy the luck in the new year.** There are other traditions from around the world that, like Spain’s grape-eating, have found their way to the United States.

注 heartily 食欲旺盛に
　 chime チャイム, 鐘の音
