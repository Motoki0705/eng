〔Ⅰ〕 次の英文の下線部を和訳せよ。

Americans consume 21 million barrels of oil every day to fuel our cars, heat our homes and power our farms, factories and cities. **In this country, people are nearly as dependent on oil as on the air they breathe.** **Luckily, air is unlimited. But oil, one of the most critical natural resources, is not.** That is why scientists are searching for other ways to meet the nation’s energy needs. Alternative solutions such as capturing the power of the sun and wind are already being used across the country and around the world.
