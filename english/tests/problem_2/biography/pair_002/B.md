Frida Kahlo, born in Mexico City in 1907, is now celebrated as one of the most significant artists of the twentieth century. However, her path to artistic success was marked by tremendous pain and personal struggle. At the age of six, she contracted polio, which left her right leg thinner and shorter than her left. Despite this disability, she was active and ambitious, and her parents enrolled her in a prestigious preparatory school where she planned to study medicine.

In 1925, when Kahlo was eighteen, her life changed dramatically. The bus she was riding collided with a streetcar, and she suffered devastating injuries including a broken spinal column, collarbone, and pelvis, as well as eleven fractures in her right leg. She would undergo more than thirty operations during her lifetime and spent months recovering in a full-body plaster cast. It was during this difficult period of recovery that she began painting seriously.

Unable to leave her bed, Kahlo asked her parents to set up a special easel that allowed her to paint while lying down. Her mother had a mirror installed on the ceiling above her bed, and Kahlo began creating the self-portraits for which she would become famous. Of the 143 paintings she created during her lifetime, 55 were self-portraits. She once explained, "I paint myself because I am so often alone and because I am the subject I know best."

In 1929, Kahlo married the famous Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, who was 20 years older than her. Their relationship was passionate but troubled, marked by both affairs and Rivera's inability to remain faithful. They divorced in 1939, only to remarry a year later. Throughout their tumultuous relationship, they maintained a deep artistic respect for each other.

Kahlo's paintings were deeply personal, often depicting her physical suffering, her feelings about her childlessness (she had several miscarriages due to her injuries), and her complex identity as a woman of mixed European and indigenous Mexican heritage. She incorporated vivid colors and symbolic imagery drawn from Mexican folk art and pre-Columbian culture.

During her lifetime, Kahlo's work was often overshadowed by that of her more famous husband. She had only one solo exhibition in Mexico, which took place in 1953, just a year before her death. She arrived at the opening in an ambulance and watched the event from a bed that had been set up in the gallery. She died in 1954 at the age of 47. In the decades since her death, her reputation has grown enormously, and she is now considered an icon of feminist art and Mexican culture.
