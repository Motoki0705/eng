Nelson Mandela, born in 1918 in a small village in South Africa, became one of the most influential political leaders of the twentieth century. As a young man, he studied law and became involved in the fight against apartheid, the system of racial segregation that had been established by the white minority government. In 1944, he joined the African National Congress (ANC), which was working to achieve equal rights for all South Africans.

For many years, Mandela and the ANC pursued peaceful methods of protest. However, after the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, when police killed 69 unarmed protesters, Mandela became convinced that peaceful resistance alone would not be enough to end apartheid. He helped establish a military wing of the ANC and was arrested in 1962 for leaving the country illegally and encouraging workers to strike. Two years later, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Mandela spent 27 years in prison, much of it on Robben Island, a harsh prison off the coast of Cape Town. During his imprisonment, he became an international symbol of resistance against oppression. Despite the difficult conditions, Mandela continued to study, earning a law degree through a correspondence course. He also refused offers of freedom that were conditional on renouncing violence as a political tool.

In the 1980s, pressure on the South African government intensified from both inside and outside the country. International sanctions damaged the economy, and protests within South Africa grew more frequent and widespread. In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk finally ordered Mandela's release. The two leaders then worked together to negotiate a peaceful transition to democracy.

In 1993, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end apartheid peacefully. The following year, in the first democratic elections in South Africa's history, Mandela was elected president, becoming the country's first Black head of state. During his presidency, he focused on reconciliation between the formerly divided communities rather than revenge.

Mandela established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which gave victims and perpetrators of apartheid-era violence the opportunity to tell their stories. He believed that acknowledging past wrongs was essential for moving forward as a united nation. After serving one term as president, Mandela chose not to seek re-election, setting an important example for other African leaders. He died in 2013 at the age of 95, mourned by people around the world.
