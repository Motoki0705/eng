Steve Jobs, born in San Francisco in 1955, was one of the most innovative business leaders of the modern era. He was adopted as an infant by Paul and Clara Jobs, a working-class couple who promised his biological mother that he would attend college. Jobs did enroll at Reed College in Oregon, but he dropped out after just one semester because he felt guilty about spending his parents' money on courses that seemed meaningless to him.

However, Jobs continued attending classes that interested him, including a calligraphy course that would later influence the typography of Apple computers. In 1976, at the age of 21, he co-founded Apple Computer with his friend Steve Wozniak in his family's garage. The Apple II, released in 1977, became one of the first successful mass-produced personal computers and made both founders wealthy young men.

The success continued with the Macintosh in 1984, which introduced a graphical user interface to mainstream consumers. However, internal power struggles at Apple led to Jobs being forced out of the company he had founded. Rather than retire, Jobs started a new computer company called NeXT and also acquired a small animation studio that would eventually become Pixar.

Under Jobs's leadership, Pixar produced Toy Story in 1995, the first entirely computer-animated feature film, which was a massive commercial and critical success. The company went on to create numerous beloved films including Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, and Up. Jobs eventually sold Pixar to Disney, making him Disney's largest individual shareholder.

Meanwhile, Apple was struggling without Jobs's vision. In 1997, the company acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back as a consultant and then as CEO. He transformed Apple from a company on the verge of bankruptcy into one of the most valuable companies in the world. The iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad revolutionized their respective industries and changed how people interact with technology.

Jobs was known for his demanding perfectionism and his ability to inspire both devotion and fear in his employees. He was also famous for his memorable presentations, his simple black turtleneck outfit, and his "reality distortion field" — his ability to convince people that seemingly impossible things could be achieved. Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, he initially tried alternative treatments before eventually having surgery. He continued working until shortly before his death in October 2011, at the age of 56.
