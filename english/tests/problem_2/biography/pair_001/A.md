Marie Curie, born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland in 1867, is one of the most famous scientists in history. At that time, Poland was under Russian rule, and educational opportunities for women were extremely limited. Despite these challenges, young Maria was determined to pursue higher education. After saving money for years by working as a governess, she finally moved to Paris at the age of 24 to study physics and mathematics at the Sorbonne.

In Paris, she changed her first name to the French "Marie" and began her remarkable academic journey. Despite facing financial difficulties and social prejudice as a foreign woman in a male-dominated field, she excelled in her studies. In 1893, she earned her degree in physics, finishing first in her class, and the following year she received a second degree in mathematics.

It was during this time that she met Pierre Curie, a French physicist who shared her passion for science. They married in 1895 and began one of the most productive scientific partnerships in history. Working together in a small laboratory, often in difficult conditions with little funding, they investigated the mysterious rays that had recently been discovered by Henri Becquerel. Marie coined the term "radioactivity" to describe these rays.

In 1898, the Curies announced the discovery of two new elements: polonium, named after Marie's homeland Poland, and radium. This groundbreaking work earned them, along with Becquerel, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. Marie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. However, initially the Nobel Committee had planned to honor only Pierre and Becquerel, and it was only after Pierre insisted that his wife be included that she received the recognition she deserved.

Tragedy struck in 1906 when Pierre was killed in a street accident. Devastated but determined to continue their work, Marie took over Pierre's position at the Sorbonne, becoming the first female professor at the university. In 1911, she won a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her research on radium and its compounds. She remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.

During World War I, Marie Curie made another significant contribution by developing mobile X-ray units, nicknamed "petites Curies," that could be brought to the front lines to help treat wounded soldiers. She personally drove one of these vehicles to assist medical teams. After the war, she continued her research and helped establish the Radium Institute in Paris, which became a major center for nuclear physics and chemistry research.

Marie Curie died in 1934 from aplastic anemia, almost certainly caused by her prolonged exposure to radiation during her research. At the time, the dangers of radiation were not fully understood, and she often carried test tubes of radioactive materials in her pockets. Today, her laboratory notebooks are so radioactive that they must be stored in lead-lined boxes. Her remarkable life and achievements continue to inspire scientists, especially women pursuing careers in science.
