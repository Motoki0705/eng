〔Ⅱ〕 次の英文の内容と合致するものを下の11～20の中から四つ選び、その番号を記入せよ。

Climate change is driving a significant shift in agricultural practices around the world. Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events are forcing farmers to adapt or face declining yields. While some regions may initially benefit from warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons, the overall impact of climate change on global food production is expected to be negative.

One of the most pressing challenges is water scarcity. Many of the world's most productive agricultural regions depend on irrigation from rivers and underground aquifers. As glaciers that feed major rivers shrink and groundwater levels decline due to overuse, farmers are being forced to find new ways to grow crops with less water. Drip irrigation systems, which deliver water directly to plant roots with minimal waste, are becoming increasingly popular.

Crop scientists are working to develop new varieties of plants that can withstand harsher conditions. Drought-tolerant corn, heat-resistant wheat, and salt-tolerant rice are among the varieties being developed through both traditional breeding techniques and genetic modification. However, developing and deploying these new crops takes time, and there is no guarantee that they will be able to keep pace with the rate of climate change.

Some farmers are looking to the past for solutions. Traditional farming practices, developed over centuries in challenging environments, often contain wisdom that modern agriculture has overlooked. Agroforestry, which integrates trees with crops and livestock, can help regulate temperature, improve soil health, and provide additional income for farmers. Cover crops and reduced tillage can increase soil's ability to retain water and carbon.

The economics of climate adaptation present their own challenges. Many of the most vulnerable farmers — those in developing countries with limited resources — are least able to afford the investments needed to adapt their practices. International efforts to support climate adaptation in agriculture have increased, but funding remains far short of what is needed.

Urban farming is another area of growing interest. By growing food closer to consumers, urban farms can reduce transportation emissions and provide fresh produce to city residents. While urban farming cannot replace traditional agriculture, it can complement it by providing locally grown food while reducing some of the environmental impacts associated with long-distance food transportation.
