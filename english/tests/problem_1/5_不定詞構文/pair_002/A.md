〔Ⅰ〕 次の英文の下線部を和訳せよ。

The art of negotiation requires both skill and patience. Many business deals fail not because of disagreements over price, but because of cultural misunderstandings. **What you need to learn first is how to read non-verbal cues, and this skill is too subtle to be taught in a classroom, to say nothing of being mastered through textbooks alone.** Experienced negotiators develop this ability through years of practice and countless real-world interactions.

注 negotiation 交渉
　 non-verbal cues 非言語的な合図
　 subtle 微妙な
