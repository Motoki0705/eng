〔Ⅰ〕 次の英文の下線部を和訳せよ。

Urban planning has evolved significantly over the past century. Early planners focused primarily on efficiency and sanitation, often ignoring the human need for green spaces. **Today, however, cities are designed with careful attention to parks and gardens, in which residents can escape from daily stress, and wherever possible, trees are planted along streets, which helps reduce air pollution.** This shift reflects a growing understanding that urban environments profoundly affect mental and physical health.
